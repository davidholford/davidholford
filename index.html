    <p><i>Our story is as old as time... </i></p>
    <p><i>Boy and girl meet at mutual friends party, both are instantly attracted to one another.
          In the following days the boy and girl begin to hang out more and more frequently eventually building feelings for one another.
          After a couple months of this, the boy starts to see his future intertwined with the girls and asks her to be his girlfriend.
          The girl gladly says yes! For the next three years the two do everything together, camping trips with friends,
          road trips to Arizona to visit family, romantic nights spent in Denver, concerts, sports games, and finally the momentous
          trip to Mexico.</i></p>
    <p><i>While in Mexico, under a clear night sky, with some of their closest friends and family, the boy mustered the
          <del>liquid</del> courage to get down on one knee and ask the girl to marry him. With tears in both their eyes she says yes!
          Now both the boy and girl are looking forward to their future together. With the sky as their limit, and the possibilites endless,
          they are ready to begin a new adventure.</i></p><br>

    <h1>Dress code?</h1>
    <p>This is an outdoor country wedding so leave your ball gown and suit at home! Put on your boots (if you have them) and 
      dress for warm weather. We suggest that you wear close toed shoes since it will be outsite in the dirt and there are rocks around. 
      Your more then welcome to wear shorts</p>
    <h1>Food and drink?</h1>
    <p>Who loves tacos? Good, because we will have a taco bar with all the fixings! We will have water, soda, beer, and some hard
      liquir. If you would like to bring something special for yourself you are more then welcome to!</p>
    <h1>Access to the Ranch?</h1>
    <p>When you come to the gate, if it is not open, the gate code is either 0230 or 0430.</p>
    <h1>Cell service?</h1>
    <p>Service can be spoty. Verizon seems to have good coverage but T-Mobile has almost none. Not sure about Att and Sprint We suggest that you write the directions
    and the gate code down before you leave just incase.</p>

    <p>From I-80 you will exit the highway at the Snowy Range Rd exit (exit 311) and head West</p>
    <p>Continue on Snowy Range Rd and take a right following the sighns for highway 130. </p>
    <p>Stay on highway 130 for aprox. 13 miles. You will take a left onto Big Hallow Rd. We have put up a sign indicating where
    to turn, but there is also a large white sign on the left at the turn that says Wild Horse Ranch</p>
    <p>Continue on Big Hallow Rd for about 2.5 miles and take a right at the large gate. You will need to use the code above if
    the gate is not open</p>
    <p>Continue straigh ahead until you reach Wild West Way and take a right. The barn will be half a mile up on the right.</p>
